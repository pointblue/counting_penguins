The goal of cmi-penguin-pipeline is to house the code for NSF project
\#... that runs YOLOv5 object detection models to detect 3 classes of
Adele Penguin at colonies in Antarctica. This repo is self-contained and
includes a test image, the models, and the code to filter and save
predictions as shapefiles for further analysis. For brief instructions on
how to train [see here](training_instuctions.md)

This project is an effort led by [Conservation
Metrics](https://www.conservationmetrics.com "CMI") and [Point Blue Conservation
Science](https://www.pointblue.org "PointBlue") , and ...

### Requirements:

-   RStudio (Version \>=1.4.1106)
-   \~600 mb free harddrive space

Tested on Windows 10, Windows Server 2019

### To get started:

-   Clone this repository somewhere you would like it to live
-   Run the R notebook `cmi-penguin-pipeline.Rmd` in the newest version
    of RStudio (Version \>=1.4.1106)

We recommend using the `Projects` menu in RStudio to create a
`New Project` from `Version Control` using `git`. Paste
`https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/cmi-penguin-pipeline.git` for
the `url` (it should autofill the name) and choose a location on your
computer where you would like to store the repo (I store my git repos in
`D:/git_repos` as git and Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, etc. often do not
get along).

Alternatively you can run the following on the command line:

    cd some/folder/where/you/want/to/clone
    git clone https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/cmi-penguin-pipeline.git

The notebook `cmi-penguin-pipeline.Rmd` is setup to run both `R` and
`python` code chunks from within `RStudio` using the `retriculated`
package. We are using `miniconda` + `conda` environment to avoid
changing anything about your base `python` installation. Everything
about the environment is configured from within the notebook.

### Have questions or a problem?

If you have questions or run into a problem running this notebook,
please open an issue on Github
[here](https://github.com/ConservationMetrics/cmi-penguin-pipeline/issues).
