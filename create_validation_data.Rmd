## Overview
This .Rmd is set up to create a validation data set of labeled images for testing YOLO predictions.
It is intended to be run in multiple sessions to continue adding to the data set.
It requires a subset of images already randomly selected and placed in their own subdirectory in an aws s3 bucket.
It also requires an R script, validation_functions.R that has two essential functions.

## Getting set up
```{r setup, eval = TRUE, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# packages required
library(tidyverse)
library(googledrive)
library(googlesheets4)
library(aws.s3)

# source functions you will be using
# if running this from wherever you cloned the repo, shouldn't need to alter this path
# can make changes to this .Rmd and save them locally, but don't push to repo
source("scripts/validation_functions.R")


```
## set up some parameters
```{r setup google environment}
# these are for google drive access
# the first time you run this you will need to authorize R to access google drive
# drive_auth()
# gs4_auth(token = drive_token())
# provide
file_url <-
  "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12v3ViLtCePuyHsTxyx735qKxZydHxMzCetm6k7Ec6IE/edit?usp=sharing"

```

```{r set up aws} 
# set these for aws access
# set region for s3 bucket access
Sys.setenv("AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-2")

# some of these used by both functions
bucket <- 
  "s3://deju-penguinscience/"

prefix <-
"PenguinCounting/croz_20191202_tiles/"


# set your temporary working directory
# NOTE: this directory will get cleared so best to make a fresh one on your desktop for this purpose. Make sure it has the trailing slash.
wd <-
  "set_to_your_working_directory/" 

# set your initials
initials <-
  "your_initials"


```

## Download images to tag
This function will check the pick list for available images, download the images, and update the picklist.
There is no undo so make sure you complete the images you download.
Running the function will also place a label key in the specified directory that can be used with makesense.ai
For current test parameters are as follows:
```{r run tile picker}
# Run tile picker function including your initials
# n = the number of images it will download. Recommend doing small chunks of 3-5 so you can ensure you complete them all

tile_picker(
 tile_list = data_tab,
 bucket = bucket,
 prefix = prefix,
 initials = initials,
 wd = wd,
 n = 5, 
 file_id = file_url)

# now you can upload the images to makesense.ai to tag
# once done with tagging, make sure to export annotations as a zip file in YOLO format and continue to next step

```

## Upload label data and combine with existing data
Run update_labs function to update label data in s3

```{r run label updater}
# function will prompt you to select the .zip file you just exported
# it will update the label.csv and the tile list to summarize which tiles were tagged and how many labels of each class were in each tile
# it will also clear your working directory but will prompt you to confirm first
# if you enter anything other that "y", the function will exit without clearing the files

update_labs(
  bucket,
  prefix,
  file_id = file_url)

```
